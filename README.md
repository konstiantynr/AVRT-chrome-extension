My Chrome Extension for Auto visual regression testing

## User flow

1. User clicks extension icon

2. In the background, the extension loads the page multiple times in a visual website regression tool. 

3. If a visual difference is found in the regressions, the user is notified and the area with differences is highlighted on the page for the user. Note: Regression will have to be run 10 times to ensure that weâ€™ve found all variations. 

4. The user can then toggle between the version of the page they originally saw and the versions of the page that were found in the regression testing.
